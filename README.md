## Toy VM

Lets build a small virtual machine, just for the fun of it!

The machine has the following main characteristics: 

- byte addresseable
- has a separate stack and heap

Release history: 
0.0.1: 	absolute basic version with 10 instructions and a basic assembler 
				for a part of the instructions (should be enough to get the 
				principle across for further development). 				

0.0.2:  implement label resolution in assembler and allow to make VM testrun 				with binary and assembler input.
